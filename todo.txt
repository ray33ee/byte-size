REPETITIONS
    - Add repeatable sequences allowing up to 32 repetitions
        - Repetitions include ascii characters, and also other strings commonly repeated ('hehe',. 'ha ha', 'soooooo', etc. with capital letters too).
        - Create a special ascii table that includes commonly repeated sequences in the gaps
        - Match repetitions before numbers and compare which is better

TABLES
    - Use build scripts to generate the tables.rs file at build time
