- Reorganise source directory structure
- Make sure build script only takes 240 OBW, 1793 TBC and 16512 TBU sequences.
- Figure out why docs.rs upload failed
    - Edit: failed because docs.rs couldn't find the txt files we  use to generate the maps in the build script
- Use a better system for matching the Custom words (maybe use a bimap)
- Phase out the Matcher trait and its implementations
