- Figure out why 'their' is represented as 3 OBW and one 1 TBU.

SEARCH PERFORMANCE
    - Find a better way to search tables for entries (bear in mind that a hash map won't work as we don't know how much we are matching from the main string)
     - Maybe some sort of binary tree?
        - Use rust's b tree and create our own custom type and custom comparison algorithm using the `Ord` trait
            - Make sure this algorithm matches an entry like 'download' before 'down'. (i.e. given 2 strings that have the same beginning, the largest should match)
     - Or maybe break a set down into a list of hashmaps arranged by the size of the string

REPETITIONS
    - Add repeatable sequences allowing up to 32 repetitions
        - Repetitions include ascii characters, and also other strings commonly repeated ('hehe',. 'ha ha', 'soooooo', etc. with capital letters too).
        - Create a special ascii table that includes commonly repeated sequences in the gaps
        - Match repetitions before numbers and compare which is better

TABLES
    - Use build scripts to generate the tables.rs file at build time
